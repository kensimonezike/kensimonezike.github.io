# Intelligent Solar-Powered Immunization Vaccine Storage System
### By Ezike Kensimon

This paper titled “Intelligent Solar-powered Immunization Vaccine Storage System” is aimed at improving the vaccine cold chain system in rural areas through the provision of an Intelligent Solar-powered immunization vaccine storage system. The systems objectives include: Developing a solar panel that will generate electricity from sunlight, to determine the rating of the charge controller and capacity of the battery, to develop a cooling holder that will isolate the vaccine and have a control system which ensures that the required temperature is maintained, to develop the user and operator interface that will display the temperature of the system and, to develop a computerized system that will monitor the potency of the vaccine and warns when the cold chain temperature drops. The systems circuit’s diagram was first designed and simulated using Proteus 8 software. Solar panel of 300W, battery of 180AH, thermoelectric of 12v, 10mA, 120W, temperature sensor of 5V, 20mA, 0.1W, LED of 2V, 10mA, 0.04W and ATMEGA 328P of 5V, 16mA, 0.08W were the hardware used. For the software requirements, Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) were used to write and upload the program using C++ programming language. The developed prototype was tested satisfactorily to ensure that vaccines were kept and preserved at the required temperature of 2℃ and 8℃. In conclusion, the vaccine storage system that is able to alleviate the problem of wastage of vaccines due to poor electricity in the rural areas has been developed.
