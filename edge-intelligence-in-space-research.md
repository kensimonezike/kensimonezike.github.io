## Introduction

Modern space missions generate massive volumes of data—far too much to downlink raw to Earth within the limits of traditional communication systems. Satellites, rovers, and deep-space probes rely on sophisticated sensors such as high-resolution optical imagers, SAR radar, hyperspectral scanners, and multispectral payloads, each producing terabytes of data. Historically, spacecraft used a “bent-pipe” model, transmitting raw data to ground stations for offline analysis. While simple, this approach introduces severe delays, limited bandwidth, and low responsiveness—creating major bottlenecks in missions that require real-time decision-making.

Edge intelligence changes this paradigm.

Instead of depending entirely on Earth-based computing, **edge AI places computational capability directly on satellites, rovers, and orbital platforms**, enabling immediate onboard data processing. For time-critical tasks—mapping disasters, detecting vessels, navigating planetary terrain—this shift is transformative. Missions that once waited hours for human review can now act in seconds.

## Why Edge Intelligence Is Needed in Space

Traditional space systems suffer from:

- High communication latency  
- Limited downlink bandwidth  
- Infrequent ground contact windows  
- Heavy reliance on human decision-making  
- Increasing sensor complexity and data volume  

Edge intelligence solves these challenges by enabling **onboard autonomy**, **instant inference**, and **bandwidth-efficient data transmission**. A satellite can detect events like fires, floods, or ships at sea and transmit only the relevant results—not gigabytes of raw imagery.

## What This Paper Covers

This work provides a comprehensive review of edge AI for space systems, including:

- Fundamentals of edge computing and enabling technologies  
- Spacecraft system architecture and constraints  
- Integration of onboard accelerators (FPGAs, GPUs, NPUs)  
- On-orbit AI applications: navigation, Earth observation, health monitoring  
- Distributed intelligence, satellite constellations, and federated learning  
- Limitations: radiation, power constraints, thermal challenges  
- Future trends: neuromorphic chips, laser communications, large foundation models  
- Real case studies, including IMAGIN-e, FPGA-based SAR detection, and GPU@SAT  

The paper shows that edge intelligence is not theoretical—it is already operational and rapidly expanding.

## The Shift Toward Autonomous Space Systems

As space missions grow more complex, the need for autonomy becomes critical. Rovers navigating Mars, satellites analyzing Earth in real time, and constellations coordinating through inter-satellite links all require onboard intelligence. Edge AI replaces slow, single-point ground processing with distributed, resilient computation embedded directly within spacecraft.

This transition marks the beginning of a new era: **space systems that think, decide, and collaborate in orbit.**
